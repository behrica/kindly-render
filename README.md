# kindly-render

![Kindly logo](Kindly.svg)

`kindly-render` is a Clojure library for rendering kinds as markdown or html.

[Clay](https://github.com/scicloj/clay) is for literate and interactive programming.
This library was extracted from Clay to be more useful to other visual tool developers.
The hope is to make it convenient to share visualizations between tools.

## Related projects

[Kindly](https://scicloj.github.io/kindly-noted/kindly) is a common ground for defining how things should be visualized, seeking compatibility across tools.

[kindly-advice](https://scicloj.github.io/kindly-noted/kindly_advice) is a library that helps tools such as Clay to be Kindly-compatible.

[read-kinds](https://github.com/scicloj/read-kinds) is used internally by Claykind (and soon by Clay as well) to generate Kindly advice from notebooks expressed as Clojure namespaces.

[Claykind](https://github.com/timothypratley/claykind) is rethinking the Clay architecture and implementation from scratch, in a new code base. The two projects are being developed in coordination.

## Rationale

Visual tool makers may benefit from having a shared collection of viewers for kinds.
